So, as had become customary, AG-88301, with ever decreasing levels of gratitude or appreciation, made Macaque do his homework for him. At this point, Macaque had had enough, and turned to his minions (you guys!) to solve AG-88301's homework task.</span></span></p><p>You are given an integer $$$n$$$.
